## Overview

I am currently following a [React Native course available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obH0Po_RdWk&list=PPSV). The course provides step-by-step guidance on React Native development, allowing me to track my progress and review the final code. Along the way, I'm also incorporating my own additions based on my experience, preferences, and knowledge of code organization and best practices that I've gathered from various sources.

**Currently doing: Loading state and API.**
